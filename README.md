# Python_library_projects
These are study tools I'm building for myself as I learn Python and its libraries from books and videos. 
So far I have the core language and Numpy, and coming soon are: Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborne, StatsModels, and finally a Django based website for PhysicsInsight!
