The first file (AAPL) is a dataframe for Apple's stock, used at one point for a timeseries analysis, it is one of several files containing the dataframe analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook. The following "Analysis_with_..." files are work samples for either the proper Python language or the corresponding Python library. 

In the near future I will be using Django to build PhysicsInsight and launch the prototype containing mostly derivations, proofs, and visualizations in LaTeX and Tikz. This is simply because of a pet peeve for authors leaving it to the reader to fill in the blanks in proofs and solutions, and those are of highest priority for PhysicsInsight.
